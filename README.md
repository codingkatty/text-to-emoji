# Text to Emoji w/ Gemini âœ¨
A small project of mine about text to emoji, using a server I made for Pirate AI (another project for high seas)

## What is it
Text to Emoji is a web application can transform your text into expressive emojis. It uses AI to do so, and it could generate from any language, as long as the AI understands it.

## How it works
Basically, when you input text, the AI will turn it into emoji. This works when typing is detected, a post request is sent to the server. The server communicates with the AI and returns the respond. The response is filtered to make sure there are only emojis.

## How to use
Open the website in 'about', or directly go to [this link](https://codingkatty.github.io/text-to-emoji).

## Acknowledgements
I got the idea from another project I saw when voting. I remember it didn't use AI though, it used a list of text to turn into emoji instead.
